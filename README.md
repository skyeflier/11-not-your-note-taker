## Description
This application writes and saves notes, so that the user can organize their thoughts and keep track of tasks they need to complete.

This application was created to help people keep better organized and enjoy that sweet dopamine hit that comes with completing a task and deleting it off your long list of to-dos. 

From this application I learned how to write tests and build a databse. Cool stuff!
